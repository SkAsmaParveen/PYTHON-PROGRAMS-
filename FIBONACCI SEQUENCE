'''FIBONACCI : THE SEQUENCE GENERALLY STARTS FROM 0 TO 1 . EACH NUMBER IS DEFINED AS SUM OF TWO PRECEEDING NUMBERS '''

'''THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM IS USED TO PRINT FIBONACCI SEQUENCE USING RECURSION '''

def fib(a):
    if a <= 1:
        return a
    return fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)


n = int(input('Enter number of terms: '))
if n <=0:
    print("Please enter a valid integer")
else:
    print("Fibonacci sequence is:")
for i in range(0, n + 1):
    print(fib(i),end = ",")
    

'''MEMOISATION : IT IS A METHOD USED TO STORE  RESULT OF A PREVIOUS FUNCTION CALLS TO SPEED UP FUTURE CALCULATIONS '''

'''MEMO : A PREVIOUS COMPUTED VALUE WHICH IS STORED FOR FURTHER USE IS CALLED A MEMO ''' # PYTHONIC VERSION

'''THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM SHOWS MEMOISED VERSION OF FIBONACCI '''

known ={0:0 , 1:1}
def fib(a): 
    if a in known :
        return known[a]
    result = fib(a-1)+fib(a-2)
    known[a] = result
    return result
    
n=int(input("Enter number of terms:"))
for i in range(0,n+1):
    print(i,"the fibonacci number is:",fib(i))
print(known)

OUTPUT:
Enter number of terms:4
0 the fibonacci number is: 0
1 the fibonacci number is: 1
2 the fibonacci number is: 1
3 the fibonacci number is: 2
4 the fibonacci number is: 3
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3}
