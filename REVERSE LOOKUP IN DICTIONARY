'''SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A DICTIONARY "d" AND KEY "k" .iT IS EASY TO FIND THE CORRESPONDING VALUE BY "d[k]".THEN IT RETURNS "v".This is called   
   "  lookup"
But what if you have v and you want to find k? You have two problems: first, there might be more than one key that maps to the value v. 
Depending on the application, you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. 
Second, there is no simple syntax to do a reverse lookup; you have to search. '''

def RevLookup(d,v):
    for k in d:
        if d[k] == v:
            return k
    return -1 
Dict = { "Asma" : 1, "Parveen" : 2,"Roshi" : 3 ,"Nouri" : 4 , "Omarie" : 5 }

Value = int(input("Enter the value you are looking for :"))
k=RevLookup(Dict,Value)
if k == -1:
    print("No person found with Value" , Value)
else:
    print("The person with the given Value is:",k)
    
OUTPUT:
Enter the value you are looking for :9
No person found with Value 9
